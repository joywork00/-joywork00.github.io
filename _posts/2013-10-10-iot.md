## HERO Device Management Center
<div style="display: table;width:750px;margin:0 auto; border:#FFFFFF 1px solid;" class="text001">
<br>
The AAEON HERO Device Management Center (DMC) is a dockerized web application which can be deployed on Linuxbased and Windows-based environments.<br>
Receiving information from HERO Agent and the HERO Gateway, HERO DMC provides a feature-rich web-based dashboard for managing devices, sensors and nodes connected to HERO Gateway as well
as managing the gateway itself. <br>
Utilizing M2M technology such as MQTT, HERO DMC allows users to monitor conditions live,
or set up event alerts sent out via email or messenger services to stay ahead of any situation. If you want to keep your data on your local storage device, HERO Device Management Center can also be deployed to your private cloud without problem.

## HERO Gateway

<div style="display: table;width:750px;margin:0 auto; border:#FFFFFF 1px solid;" class="text001">
<br>
AAEON HERO Gateway is the total hardware solution utilizing AAEON embedded hardware with HERO Agent pre-installed.<br>
HERO Gateway utilizes protocols such as MQTT and OPC UA to send data securely to HERO DMC, and integrates easily with public cloud services including Microsoft Azure and AWS IoT Core. <br>
HERO Gateway devices are 4G-LTE compatible, allowing flexible connectivity with HERO DMC. <br>
With HERO Agent, the device is easily managed through the Dashboard, a web-based interface which features tools such as Device Map and Data Visualization, node device management, database and network management. <br>
Data stored on HERO Gateway can also be accessed and managed securely through the Dashboard. <br>
AAEON can also provide service for adding customized RESTful API to assist customers who wish to implement an app to manage their HERO Gateway.<br>
